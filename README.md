# whipclip demo app

Download and build this project in order to see my JUNIT tests execute the exact BASIC EXAMPLE and CONFLICT EXAMPLE provided in JavaAssignment word doc.

**Notes to code judge**

- package com.epicgamerllc.whipclip.hr.impl (found in src/main) contains my "client" code. Some implementation of Location interface was also necessary on my side.
- package com.whipclip.hr (found in src/main) contains interfaces as defined by whipclip.
- package com.epicgamerllc.whipclip.test (found in src/**test**) contains my simple JUNIT tests.
- I have not used any external libraries outside of the JDK in developing the solution as you asked, however I DID use JUNIT in order to test my code before delivery.
- I usually use a checkstyle definition to match some syntatical styles. I ignored that to save some time; please trust that my usual solution would be "prettier" and perhaps contain less verbose comments
